# Dropbox to post
Create post with each single image from a dropbox folder. 
You can schedule x number of posts to be created daily, hourly or as per custom cron schedule.
The plugin allow to enter unlimited title and content. The Post will be created by randomly using a title & content, and the image as featured image.

## Requirements
Dropbox user access token. The plugin doesn't follow the oAuth2 authorization process, rather it uses the user access token which can be generated from your dropbox app settings page.
